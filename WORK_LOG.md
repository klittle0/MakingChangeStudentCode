I plan to mimic the way I would solve this problem mentally by keeping track of the max #s of each coin that can fit into the target value, then using those values with for loops to find all solutions. I realized using solely for loops would be too time-intensive, so I'm incorporating a recursive method. |

With Mr. Blick's help, we got the solution to work, except it is very time-intensive because it doesn't use dynamic programming. We tried to think through a way of incorporating dynamic programming. |
| Jan 27 | 3:45-5:20pm  | I continued thinking about how to incorporate dynamic programming. I've decided to create an array that stores the # of ways I can create a given target value. I looked back through my heating up code for inspiration. I've decided that I will try to create all target values that are represented by target - all coin values. I started implementing this new method, drawing out a lot of test cases to visualize my code. |
