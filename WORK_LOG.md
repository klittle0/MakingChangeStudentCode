| Jan 26 | 4:15-5:00pm  |                                                                                      I wrote pseudocode and started writing my solution. I plan to mimic the way I would solve this problem mentally by keeping track of the max #s of each coin that can fit into the target value, then using those values with for loops to find all solutions. I realized using solely for loops would be too time-intensive, so I'm incorporating a recursive method. |
| Jan 27 | 12:45-1:45pm |                                                                                                                                 Liliana, Sierra, and I worked through a fully recursive solution on the board with pseudocode, then wrote the code. With Mr. Blick's help, we got the solution to work, except it is very time-intensive because it doesn't use dynamic programming. We tried to think through a way of incorporating dynamic programming. |
| Jan 27 | 3:45-5:20pm  |                         I continued thinking about how to incorporate dynamic programming. I've decided to create an array that stores the # of ways I can create a given target value. I looked back through my heating up code for inspiration. I've decided that I will try to create all target values that are represented by target - all coin values. I started implementing this new method, drawing out a lot of test cases to visualize my code. |
| Jan 29 | 9:30-10:00am | I finished my first dynamic solution, but now all values in my numWays array equal 0. I realized that, by returning 0 if a solution was invalid, I wasn't properly adjusting my numWays map, so I fixed that. Still, I can't figure out why all values are being set to 0. I think it's because I'm not setting numWays[] at the right times, so I'm overriding the true values with 0, but I can't figure out where else I should be updating the values. |
| Feb 3  | 6:00-6:40am  |                                                                                               I went over the problem set theory slides and implemented the memoization approach. At first, I couldn't figure out where to actually save values into my numWays 2d array, especially since this problem set is different than Heating Up, but I decided to add it to my recursive call at the end of the recursive method, which works for all test cases. |
